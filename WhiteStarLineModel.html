            This model reads and interprets lidar and radar data from a csv or text file in order to determine 	    the position, mass and volume of icebergs. This model has been written as part of a university 	    	    project based on a hypothetical scenario where the White Start Line shipping company has set out a 	    criteria for such a model to help them determine the position of icebergs and whether they can be 	    	    tugged out of the way. This would, in theory, help in planning shipping routes and save time and 	    	    money by determining whether a tugboat would be successful if sent out with a ship to clear a 	    	    route (a tug boat, in this model, can only move an iceberg if the mass is less than 36 million 	    	    kilograms).
        </p>

	<p>
            This application has a simple graphical user interface which will appear when the program is run 	    	    and the user can browse their files and select the radar and lidar data that is to be input into 	    	    the model. Once this has been done the 'Run' button can be pressed to generate the model output - 	    	    a map of the area showing the position of any icebergs, their given ID, mass and volume. The 	    	    identified icebergs are colour coded based on whether they exceed the threshold mass for tugging, 	    	    red if they cannot be tugged and green if they can; the background colour has been set to blue and 	    has been assumed to represent the sea, however, it is possible that some of this area is not 	    	    actually sea.

            Please note: This model has been scripted using Python version 3.6.5. Issues may be encountered if 	    you have installed and are trying to run the model using a different version of Python.
