            <img class="imagefeature" src="ABM_model.PNG" width="500"

        <p>
            This model describes the interaction of a number of generated agents with each other and the 	    	    environment. Agents are able to move about the environment, eat from the environment store at 	    	    their position, be sick and deposit most of their store at their current position if they have 	    	    consumed too much and share their resources equally with other agents within a specified radius of 	    themselves.
        </p>

	<p>

	    The user is able to choose a number the input parameters:
	
	</p>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>number of agents</li>
                <li>store capacity</li>
                <li>consumption rate </li>
                <li>move cost</li>
		<li>neighbourhood</li>
		<li>environment growth rate</li>
		<li>number of iterations</li>
		<li>animation frame interval</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The model is set to run until the specified number of iterations has been completed or until one 	    	    of the agents stores has fallen below zero after the eating, moving, sharing with neighbours 	    	    actions have been resolved for that iteration. This simulates that one of the agents has been 	    	    unable to sustain themselves and has effectively died. The user will know if this has happened 	     	    because the message 'Stopping condition implemented after [number of completed iterations] 	    	    iterations because at least one agent store fell below zero' will be printed to the screen.
        </p>

	<p>
	    It is possible to set a number of different runs at once, each with a different combination of 	    	    specified input parameters if the user is interested in analysing the difference in  model 	    	    outcomes as a result of varying inputs. To do this the model must be run from the model_runner.py 	    	    file rather than the model.py file.
	</p>

	<p>
	    There is a simple command line user interface that the user can interact with to specify the 	    	    parameters they wish to enter into the model. The user simply needs to follow the instructions 	    	    when the file is run. Alternatively, instruction can be found in the readme.txt file with the 	    	    download files.

        <p>
            Please note: This model has been scripted using Python version 3.6.5. Issues may be encountered if 	    you have installed and are trying to run the model using a different version of Python.
